                    <p>This client desired a user-friendly website with a relaxed color scheme. We integrated Google Analytics for tracking and PayPal for seamless online payments. The site includes multiple forms for customer inquiries, capturing details such as dates needed, phone number, address, and availability, which are automatically emailed to the client upon submission. We also crafted a smooth and cohesive About and Contact section, and included additional payment options like Venmo for convenience.</p>

                    <p>For this gift-giving website, we utilized the client's preferred photos and designed the theme to align perfectly. We created an intuitive interface featuring integrated PayPal subscription buttons and Google Analytics for tracking. The product photos were used as background images that transition between various visuals, with overlay text to provide a premium feel. Additionally, we included pages such as Contact, Subscription, and Individual Products, allowing users to customize their selections by choosing images. These choices are then sent to our client upon form submission.</p>

We ensured a premium feel with a straightforward yet professional design. Our primary focus was on optimizing SEO by utilizing various meta tags and keyword search tools to help them compete in a highly competitive field.</p>
